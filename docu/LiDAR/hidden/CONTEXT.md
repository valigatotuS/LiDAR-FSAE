1.  *What type of LiDAR sensor will you be using for your project, and what are its specifications (e.g., range, resolution, field of view, etc.)?*

For the moment I am using a cheap LiDAR sensor on the TurtleBot3 burger model as a first proof of concept. 

2.  *What is the overall goal of your thesis, and what specific problems will you be trying to solve or answer through your work?*

The overall goal of my thesis is to develop research in the LiDAR domain to contribute to the research and development of our formula student race team. Specific problems would be if it is possible and a good idea of using a LiDAR camera on our car in order to participate to the driverless events. Defining the specific LiDAR camera needs is also a challenge. Defining where on the car it has to be mounted ? How many camera's would we need to offer a first simple and efficient solution ? Developping the software for the perception of the cones who defines the track.

3. *Have you already started your research, or are you still in the planning stages? If you have already started, what methods or techniques have you considered for the perception and mapping tasks, and how well have they worked so far?*


I am currently in the research stage but I need to review my current planning. I have already started the research on the subject but I need to gain a lot more knowledge and insights on the topic. The techniques I already developed for the perception of the cones with the TurtleBot3 was to detect 2 cones based on a minima of consecutive number of points, it was working but need a lot of improvements for a serious use. I have not done any mappings tasks as I first focused on the perception. 

4. Are there any specific challenges or limitations you have encountered so far, or that you anticipate encountering during your work?

The challenges at the moment is that my mathematical knowledge is not on an advanced level and the fact that I am using cheap material.

5. Could a 2D LiDAR camera be used for a driverless race ? what are the limitations of such a system compared to a 3D camera ?

cones can be detected using a 2D LiDAR camera, although the limitations of such a system compared to a 3D camera would be that it provides a less comprehensive view of the environment. A 2D LiDAR camera generates a single plane of distance measurements, while a 3D LiDAR camera generates a 3D point cloud that provides a more complete representation of the environment.

The main limitations of a 2D LiDAR camera in detecting cones compared to a 3D LiDAR camera are:

**Reduced accuracy**: The distance measurements generated by a 2D LiDAR camera are less precise than those generated by a 3D LiDAR camera, making it more difficult to accurately detect and track cones.

**Limited field of view**: A 2D LiDAR camera has a limited field of view and can only detect cones within a single plane, whereas a 3D LiDAR camera can detect cones in a much larger volume of space.

**Difficulty in detecting cones at different heights**: A 2D LiDAR camera can only detect cones in a single plane, so it would have difficulty detecting cones that are at different heights or located at different angles relative to the plane of the camera.
