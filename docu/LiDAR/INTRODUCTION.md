As a young engineer passionate about cutting-edge technology, I was always fascinated by autonomous cars. The thought of a camera being able to capture the world not just in 2D images but also in 3D, blew my mind. And when I discovered the world of Formula Student and the challenges they face in terms of perception, I knew that this was the perfect opportunity for me to dive into this exciting field.

The goal of my Master's thesis is to explore the state-of-the-art techniques in the field of LiDAR perception and to see how they can be applied to the unique demands of Formula Student race cars. The challenge of detecting cones on a track, separating them from the background, and accurately localizing them, is a complex one. But, I am determined to rise to the challenge and to find the best solution for this problem.

I am eager to explore the different algorithms that exist for object detection using a point cloud as input, to compare their strengths and weaknesses, and to determine which one would be best suited for a Formula Student race car. The work will culminate in a comprehensive study of the perception pipeline, with a focus on the innovative algorithms.
