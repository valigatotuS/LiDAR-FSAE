*Formula SAE is a student design competition organized by SAE International. The concept behind Formula SAE is that a fictional manufacturing company has contracted a student design team to develop a small Formula-style race car. 

The prototype race car is to be evaluated for its potential as a production item. The target marketing group for the race car is the non-professional weekend autocross racer. Each student team designs, builds and tests a prototype based on a series of rules, whose purpose is both ensuring on-track safety (the cars are driven by the students themselves) and promoting clever problem solving.

The prototype race car is **judged** in a number of different **events** divided in two classes: **Static and Dynamic**. Static events are compose by three different disciplines: **Engineering Design, Business Plan and Cost and Manufacturing**. Dynamic events are composed by four different disciplines: **Acceleration, Skid Pad,Autocross and Endurance**. For each discipline the following point are assigned:*

| Event                  | Points |
| ---------------------- | ------ |
| Design                 | 150    |
| Business Plan          | 75     |
| Cost and Manufacturing | 100    |
| Acceleration           | 75     |
| Skipad                 | 75     |
| Autocross              | 100    |
| Endurance              | 325    |
| Efficiency             | 100       |
