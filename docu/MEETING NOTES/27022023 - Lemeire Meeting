## Things discussed & showed
@Jan, Nick & Marco

- Development, demos & simulations
    - **Basic steering** ROS2 python scripts
    - **Perception algorithm** DBSCAN clustering & notebooks with sample data
    - **Perception plots** polar & cartesian plots
    - **Target definition** midpoint between closest points in front of the robot
    - **Live Gazebo simulations** blocking processes

- Topics discussed
    - **KNN vs DBSCAN**
    - **thesises & papers**
    - **Physical tests**
    - **Outliers filtering**
    - **Slow recognition lap and SLAM laps**

## Next steps

- Reading thesises and papers (tb3 moving packets for colruyt)
    - **Weightpoints for the routes** (Sebastian thesis)
    - **Algorithm & Tests** (Sebastian & Milan thesises)
    - **SLAM** (Durant Whyte & Cadena papers)

- Processing and driving at the same time.
    - **Merge the blocking processes** (stop -> process -> turn -> move : must happen concurrently)

- Simulating noise & Improving LiDAR pipeline
    - **Inserting random noise** in sample data (Gaussian ? Whitenoise ?)
    - **Removing noise** from sample data

- Measuring processing time of algos
    - **Measuring LiDAR pipeline sub processes**

- Physical tests with the tb3
    - **Saving tests**, rosbag or pickle files
    - **Environment tests**, Testing out on different environments

- Implementing SLAM on the tb3
    - **Maps**, updating the map in the first round then using map for the other laps
    - **Overlapping scan and Map**, SLAM & Live scan merging/overlapping  

- Research on path planning 
    - How are other **formula students** doing ?
    - What about **F1** engineers calculating that ?
    - How to make the **routes**

- Testing out FSSIM from AMZ 
    - **Simulator test**
